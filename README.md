# Self Care Center

### Summary
This project is a website where the user is able to receive a positive message of either an affirmation or mantra.  

### How it Works
- When user visits the website, they are first brought to a login page where they will be asked to provide their name to access the main page.  After clicking the 'let's go' button, the user is brought to the main page.
- On the main page, the user is able to select the message type they'd like to receive; either 'affirmation' or 'mantra'.
- User then clicks the 'receive message' button, and a randomly selected message will appear.

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

### Future Additions
- Add the capability for the user to favorite messages
- The functionality of using the 'enter' key on keyboard 
- Add dynamic functionality for the page greeting to user
